This project is a Headless WordPress website built using React as the frontend and WordPress as the backend CMS. WordPress is used only for content management, while the frontend is fully handled by React, providing better performance, flexibility, and modern UI development.

🚀 Project Overview

The frontend consumes data from WordPress using the WordPress REST API, allowing dynamic content rendering without relying on traditional WordPress themes. This architecture separates content management from presentation, making the website faster, more secure, and easier to scale.
